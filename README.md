## Running the notebooks locally

You can run the notebooks locally by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone git@github.com:finbourne/sample-notebooks.git
cd sample-notebooks
```

2. Create a `secrets.json` file in the **examples** folder with your LUSID credentials. For more details on this, see the [Using a secrets.json file](https://support.lusid.com/getting-started-with-apis-sdks) documentation.

3. Build the Docker image

```
docker build -t finbourne/lusid-sample-notebooks .
```

4. Run the Docker image

**Windows**
```bash
docker run --rm -it --name fbn-jupyter -v %cd%:/home/jovyan -e FBN_SECRETS_PATH=/home/jovyan/examples/secrets.json -p 8888:8888 finbourne/lusid-sample-notebooks
```
**macOS/linux**
```bash
docker run --rm -it --name fbn-jupyter \
  -v $(pwd):/home/jovyan \
  -e FBN_SECRETS_PATH=/home/jovyan/examples/secrets.json \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  finbourne/lusid-sample-notebooks
```

You will see something similar to the following output:
