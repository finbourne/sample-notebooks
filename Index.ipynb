    "\n",
    "This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that show how to use [LUSID](https://www.finbourne.com/lusid-technology). The examples in this repository are in Python. but the underlying LUSID functionality can be implemented using any language that has a HTTP client library. The notebooks are divided into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `features` - Notebooks showing specific LUSID features. These notebooks are short and specific.\n",
    "* `use-cases` - Notebooks showing sample business implementations or use-cases. These notebooks will combine various LUSID features to solve a business use-case. The `use-case` notebooks are generally longer than the `features` ones.\n",
