## Overview

This repository contains various sets of Jupyter notebooks. The examples in this repository are delivered through Python but the underlying LUSID functionality can be implemented using any language which can call our standard REST APIs. For ease-of-use, we have divided the notebooks into two categories:

* `features` - This folder contains notebooks showing specific LUSID features. For example, there is notebook showing how you can call holdings using a get holdings request. These notebooks are generally short and specific.
* `use-cases` - This folder contains notebooks showing sample business implemenations or use-cases. These notebooks will generally combine various LUSID features to solve a business issue. For example, there is notebook which uses the LUSID features of derived portfolios, quotes, and get holdings to backtest a trading strategy. These `use-case` notebooks are generally longer than the `feature` ones.
