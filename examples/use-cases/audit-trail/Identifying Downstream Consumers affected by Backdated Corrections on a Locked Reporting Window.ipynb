    "LUSID is a [bi-temporal system](https://support.finbourne.com/what-is-bi-temporal-data). This means that any event recorded by LUSID e.g. [Upserting Transactions](https://www.lusid.com/docs/api/#operation/UpsertTransactions) or [Setting Holdings](https://www.lusid.com/docs/api/#operation/SetHoldings) has two dates. An [asAt date](https://support.finbourne.com/what-is-asat-time) and an [effectiveAt date](https://support.finbourne.com/what-is-effectiveat-effectivefrom-time).\n",
    "\n",
    "To lock off a period for reporting purposes you may produce a bi-temporal cut-off. That is a cut-off datetime in both the effectiveAt and asAt space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example you may want to send out a report for the month of January and so you set a cut-off of the 31st of January at 11:59:59pm. This means that any backdated data entered into LUSID after the 31st of January at 11:59:59pm will not be included in the report. Furthermore any data relating to future activity for example pending settlements which occurs after the 31st of January at 11:59:59pm but was entered into the system before the 31st of January at 11:59:59pm will also not be included in the report. *Note in this example the effectiveAt and asAt datetimes are the same. This does not necessarily need to be the case.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This works great and with LUSID being bi-temporal you can produce such a report without any issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, what happens if you then discover that a serious error has been made in your report and a large number of transactions are missing? Do you stick with the locked off period? Or do you include the missing transactions to ensure your report is accurate? If you do include the missing transactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do you know which Portfolios will be affected?\n",
    "- How do you know which downstream consumers this will affect? \n",
    "- How will your downstream consumers know what changes you have made so they can also decide whether or not to re-run their reports?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook steps you through how you can answer all of these questions using LUSID via the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1)** Load some transactions to a set of Portfolios and then set a cut-off date for a report which is due to go out. Then after the cut-off date add some additional transactions to the Portfolios some of which occurred before the cut-off date (backdated transactions) and some after (amendment transactions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** Identify which Portfolios have experienced a backdated transaction which may invalidate the report. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3)** Identify which Users consumed data from these Portfolios before the cut-off date and therefore need to be notified that the report may be invalidated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4)** For a given affected User and affected Portfolio retrieve the details of all corrections so they can decide on what action to take. "

For example an addition of a position statement for the 2nd of February which may have been loaded on the 29th of January or the 1st of February and your cut-off is the 31st of January. This does not affect your report for January.  They are thus amendments and are not backdated corrections. \n",

They represent an event which has been entered into LUSID after your cut-off but affects the entity e.g. Portfolio for a date before the cut-off. For example the addition of a transaction for the 20th of January added to the system on the 3rd of February. They are backdated corrections. Any Portfolio with an event in q3 has seen a backdated correction."
