    "# Quality Control Workflow for Quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how users can create a workflow to upload quote data into LUSID. The workflow will then conduct two data quality checks on these quotes, raising any issues as exceptions for approval. This will help us to ensure the data we are upserting to LUSID is valid and suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be making use of the Workflow Service which enables you to connect and control movement of data throughout LUSID, allowing you to model data and business operational controls. You can read more about the Workflow Service in the [Knowledge Base](https://support.lusid.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-02181/en-us).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this notebook, we will consider an example where an Excel file has been uploaded to LUSID Drive. This file contains quotes for various instruments. Our workflow will then work as follows:\n",
    "1. The `ImportQuotes` task will be created and started.\n",
    "2. A worker will be triggered to import quote data, from the given file in Drive, into LUSID.\n",
    "3. A child task `ReasonableValueDataControl` will be created and started. This will trigger a worker to flag values that are not between 1 and 1000.\n",
    "4. A child task `IQROutlierDataControl` will be created and started. This will trigger a worker to flag values that are not within the interquartile range of existing quotes for that instrument. \n",
    "5. A child task `HandleException` will be created for each flagged value so a user can review any failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "An overview of our workflow is below.\n",

We will now trigger the parent task manually to import quotes in that file into LUSID before checking the data's validity and suitability. It is worth nothing that we are doing this manually, however, this can be triggered automatically by creating a webhook notification to be triggered by subscription. An example of this being implemented can be seen in this [sample notebook](https://github.com/finbourne/sample-notebooks/blob/master/examples/use-cases/portfolio-construction/Call%20Api%20On%20File%20Upload.ipynb).\n",

    "Inside of the web app, a user can examine the current state of any task that has been created as well as any children the parent task may have. By navigating to the **Workflow Service > Tasks** dashboard, one can filter by the child task `HandleException`, which will provide a list of all potentially erroneous data that our checks have found. A user can then manually resolve or ignore these tasks to transition the workflow.\n",
