    "\n",
    "Outsourcing our fund accounting was a big part of this plan, however there have been a large number of significant discrepancies between our records and those of the fund accountant. Thus we have had to set up an internal 'shadow' team to reconcile the differences between our records and those of the fund accountant. The cost of running this team almost completely negates the cost saving of outsourcing our fund accounting. In addition, there have been many times were we have just had to accept the records of the fund accountant as being correct.\n",
