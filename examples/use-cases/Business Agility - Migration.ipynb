    "One of the biggest challenges in migrating your investment records from one system to another is in ensuring that your transactions are represented correctly in the new system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is critical that the new system can interpret each transaction appropriately and determine what the underlying movements in cash and securities are.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be difficult when transactions are given esoteric types such as '1085' or 'STP' (STP is the MT940 SWIFT transaction type for Stamp Duty, but it could just as easily be an acronym for 'Sale Third Party' or 'Sale Transaction Processed'). \n",
    "\n",
    "The end result is typically a lot of time spent chasing down the handful of people in the organisation that understand the meaning of each transaction type and then laboriously mapping those to the new system's available types. This is one of the reasons that migrations between systems can take so long. "
