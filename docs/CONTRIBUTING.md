## Submitting changes

**If you have a change that you would like to contribute, please find or open an issue about it first.** You might find that somebody is already working on the issue, or there may be particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change.

To submit your change:

1. Fork our repository to your own GitHub account (this [GitHub guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) describes how to do this).
2. Clone the project to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch and clearly title it with the change.
4. Make your changes and ensure the Jupyter Notebook runs in its entirety with no issues.
5. Push your changes to your fork. We prefer for your changes to be squashed into a single commit.
6. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) to the `develop` branch of our repository.
7. The Core Team will add a “/LGTM” comment to trigger the build (note this does not approve the pull request). We will then review your code and leave any comments for you to address before we merge your change into the `master` branch.

## Code review process

The Core Team reviews pull requests on a regular basis and will give feedback on the corresponding issue in the repo. Please note:

- A build will run as part of your pull request; at a minimum, this needs to pass before your contribution is accepted.
- After feedback has been given, it is expected that you respond within two weeks. The pull request may be closed if it does not show any signs of activity.
